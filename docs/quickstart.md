# Dissect Quickstart

## Basic Usage
```bash
# Detect algorithms in a file
dissect analyze --file my_code.py

# Generate visualization
dissect visualize --file my_code.py --output flowchart
```

## Why Nodes ? 
A Node is a data structure that stores a value that can be of any data type and has a pointer to another node. The implementation of a Node class in a programming language such as Python, should have methods to get the value that is stored in the Node, to get the next node, and to set a link to the next node.

Data structures containing nodes have typically two bits of information stored in a node: data and link to next node.
